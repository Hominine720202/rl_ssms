# State Space Models for Reinforcement Learning in Tensorflow

## Work in progress!!!

This is a repository implement and evaluate some different types of State Space Models for Reinforcement Learning.
The main inspiration comes from the paper [Learning and Querying Fast Generative Models for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03006.pdf) by L. Buesing et al at DeepMind.

The thesis [Deep Latent Variable Models for Sequential Data](http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/160548008/phd475_Fraccaro_M.pdf) by Marco Fraccaro is a very valuable source of information.
